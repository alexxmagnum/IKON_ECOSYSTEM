# IKON_ECOSYSTEM — Architectural Decisions

---

## DEC-001 — Tenancy model (resolves AUD-001)

**Status:** Accepted

**Decision:** IKON_ECOSYSTEM v1 is **single-tenant** (one club per deployment).

**Consequences:**

* There is no `club_id` isolation requirement in v1.
* `Club Admin` administers the single club of the deployment.
* `Platform Admin` is reserved for platform-level operations (infrastructure, cross-cutting configuration) and does not imply multi-club data access in v1.
* Multi-tenant SaaS (multiple clubs in one database) is **out of scope** until a future decision revises this document.

**Rejected alternative:** Multi-tenant-by-default with mandatory `club_id` on all aggregates.
